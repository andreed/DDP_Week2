## Week 3 Assignment - Costs of Panini Sticker Collection

- <span style="font-size: 20px;">This is an R Markdown presentation on the cost of the Panini Sticker Collection for the World Soccer Championship 2018 in Russia.</span> 
- <span style="font-size: 20px;">I don't know, if collecting stickers for a certain sports event is as popular in the US. In Europe, it is.</span>  
- <span style="font-size: 20px;">For the world soccer championship 2018, Panini has a collection of 682 stickers. Each sticker costs 0.18 â‚¬ (there are better offers, however, my calculations use the price of the single package with 5 stickers available at every store).</span>
- <span style="font-size: 20px;">My code simulates 100 collections without trading with other collectors, so purchasing all cards until the book is complete.</span>

<span style="font-size: 20px;">The plot shows the simulations and my own experiences together. The "real life" points (four grey points) show my collection steps (up to now, 152 cards collected successfully).</span>
